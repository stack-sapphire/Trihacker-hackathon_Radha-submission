Decentralized Voting System DApp
  
This repository contains the code and documentation for a Decentralized Voting System (DApp), a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof platform designed to conduct elections and polls using blockchain technology.

The Idea: Trustless Elections
Traditional voting systems often rely on centralized authorities, leading to potential issues with security, transparency, and accountability. This DApp solves these challenges by leveraging the immutable and distributed nature of a blockchain.

Key Features include:
Transparency: All votes are recorded on a public ledger, allowing anyone to verify the results in real-time.
Immutability: Once a vote is cast, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring the integrity of the election.
Verifiable Eligibility: Only whitelisted participants (voters) are allowed to cast a vote, enforced by smart contract logic.
Automated Tallying: The smart contract automatically manages the election timeline, voting process, and final result calculation.

Architecture and Components of the DApp:
The DApp follows a standard Web3 architecture, separating the presentation layer from the core business logic, which resides entirely on the blockchain.
