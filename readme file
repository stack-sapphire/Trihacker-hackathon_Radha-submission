üèÜ Project Title: Disaster Relief Fund: Anti-Corruption Multi-Sig
Theme Alignment: Transparency & Trust, Finance & Access, Real-World Impact
üí° The Problem & Inspiration
Charitable giving for disaster relief is often plagued by a single, critical issue: centralized corruption and lack of accountability. Funds meant for victims frequently get delayed, misused, or outright stolen by a small group of officials at the top. This results in slow aid delivery and a complete breakdown of public trust.
Our inspiration is simple: Aid must be auditable and unstoppable. We replace a centralized charity treasurer with a decentralized smart contract that enforces transparency and shared governance.
üåü The Solution: 2-of-3 Multi-Signature Fund
Disaster Relief Fund is a Decentralized Application (dApp) that acts as a transparent, tamper-proof treasury.
Fund Vault: All donor money (ETH/stablecoins) is locked in a Solidity Multi-Signature Contract (DisasterReliefFund.sol).
Shared Governance: The control of the fund is assigned to a committee of three "Top Officials" (wallets).
Anti-Corruption Quorum: The contract is set up with a 2-of-3 signature rule. This means that even if one official is corrupt and refuses to approve the transfer, the other two honest officials can override the block and instantly release the aid.
Full Transparency: Every single action‚Äîthe donation, the proposal for aid, the confirmations, and the final execution‚Äîis recorded permanently on the public blockchain.
This mechanism solves the corruption problem by making it cryptographically impossible for any single person or two people to steal or unilaterally freeze the relief funds.
